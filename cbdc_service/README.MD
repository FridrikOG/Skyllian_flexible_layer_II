### Coding conventions

Here are some common C# coding conventions:

1. Use PascalCase for class, method, and property names.
2. Use camelCase for local variables and method parameters.
3. Use all uppercase for constants.
4. Use meaningful and descriptive names.
5. Place opening braces on a new line.
6. Indent code blocks with 4 spaces.
7. Add a space between keywords and their parenthesis.
8. Use "var" only when the type is obvious from the context.
9. Use using statements outside of namespace.
10. Document code with XML comments.
